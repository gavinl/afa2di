Azure Function App v2 Dependency Injection

I had some issues following some bum steers of this concept and ended up in a ball of mud whilst distracted in a meeting. This code attempts to make clear the implementation of dependency injection at the top level to lower dependencies. Planning on tackling the IConfiguration issues shortly.

If this helps, wrong, whatever; hey, let me know.

PRs welcome too.
